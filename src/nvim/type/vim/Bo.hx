		 When writing a file and a backup is made, this option tells how it's
		 done.  This is a comma-separated list of words.
		
		 The main values are:
		 "yes"	make a copy of the file and overwrite the original one
		 "no"	rename the file and write a new one
		 "auto"	one of the previous, what works best
		
		 Extra values that can be combined with the ones above are:
		 "breaksymlink"	always break symlinks when writing
		 "breakhardlink"	always break hardlinks when writing
		
		 Making a copy and overwriting the original file:
		 - Takes extra time to copy the file.
		 + When the file has special attributes, is a (hard/symbolic) link or
		   has a resource fork, all this is preserved.
		 - When the file is a link the backup will have the name of the link,
		   not of the real file.
		
		 Renaming the file and writing a new one:
		 + It's fast.
		 - Sometimes not all attributes of the file can be copied to the new
		   file.
		 - When the file is a link the new file will not be a link.
		
		 The "auto" value is the middle way: When Vim sees that renaming the
		 file is possible without side effects (the attributes can be passed on
		 and the file is not a link) that is used.  When problems are expected,
		 a copy will be made.
		
		 The "breaksymlink" and "breakhardlink" values can be used in
		 combination with any of "yes", "no" and "auto".  When included, they
		 force Vim to always break either symbolic or hard links by doing
		 exactly what the "no" option does, renaming the original file to
		 become the backup and writing a new file in its place.  This can be
		 useful for example in source trees where all the files are symbolic or
		 hard links and any changes should stay in the local source tree, not
		 be propagated back to the original source.
		 							*crontab*
		 One situation where "no" and "auto" will cause problems: A program
		 that opens a file, invokes Vim to edit that file, and then tests if
		 the open file was changed (through the file descriptor) will check the
		 backup file instead of the newly created file.  "crontab -e" is an
		 example, as are several `file-watcher` daemons like inotify.  In that
		 case you probably want to switch this option.
		
		 When a copy is made, the original file is truncated and then filled
		 with the new text.  This means that protection bits, owner and
		 symbolic links of the original file are unmodified.  The backup file,
		 however, is a new file, owned by the user who edited the file.  The
		 group of the backup is set to the group of the original file.  If this
		 fails, the protection bits for the group are made the same as for
		 others.
		
		 When the file is renamed, this is the other way around: The backup has
		 the same attributes of the original file, and the newly written file
		 is owned by the current user.  When the file was a (hard/symbolic)
		 link, the new file will not!  That's why the "auto" value doesn't
		 rename when the file is a link.  The owner and group of the newly
		 written file will be set to the same ones as the original file, but
		 the system may refuse to do this.  In that case the "auto" value will
		 again not rename the file.

		 	    characters.  Whether case is ignored depends on the kind
		 	    of completion.  For buffer text the 'ignorecase' option is

		    menu	    Use a popup menu to show the possible completions.  The
		 	    menu is only shown when there is more than one match and

		    menuone  Use the popup menu also when there is only one match.
		 	    Useful when there is additional information about the

		 	    "menu" or "menuone". No effect if "longest" is present.
		
		    noselect Same as "noinsert", except that no menu item is
		 	    pre-selected.  If both "noinsert" and "noselect" are
		 	    present, "noselect" has precedence.
		
		    nosort   Disable sorting of completion candidates based on fuzzy
		 	    scores when "fuzzy" is enabled.  Candidates will appear

		 Program to use for the ":make" command.  See `:make_makeprg`.
		 This option may contain '%' and '#' characters (see  `:_%` and `:_#`),
		 which are expanded to the current and alternate file name.  Use `::S`
		 to escape file names in case they contain special characters.
		 Environment variables are expanded `:set_env`.  See `option-backslash`
		 about including spaces and backslashes.
		 Note that a '|' must be escaped twice: once for ":set" and once for
		 the interpretation of a command.  When you use a filter called
		 "myfilter" do it like this:
		
		 ```vim
		     set makeprg=gmake\ \\\|\ myfilter
		 ```
		 The placeholder "$*" can be given (even multiple times) to specify
		 where the arguments will be included, for example:
		
		 ```vim
		     set makeprg=latex\ \\\\nonstopmode\ \\\\input\\{$*}
		 ```
		 This option cannot be set from a `modeline` or in the `sandbox`, for
		 security reasons.

		 Characters that form pairs.  The `%` command jumps from one to the
		 other.
		 Only character pairs are allowed that are different, thus you cannot
		 jump between two double quotes.
		 The characters must be separated by a colon.
		 The pairs must be separated by a comma.  Example for including '<' and
		 '>' (for HTML):
		
		 ```vim
		 	set mps+=<:>
		 ```
		 A more exotic example, to jump between the '=' and ';' in an
		 assignment, useful for languages like C and Java:
		
		 ```vim
		 	au FileType c,cpp,java set mps+==:;
		 ```
		 For a more advanced way of using "%", see the matchit.vim plugin in

		 alpha	If included, single alphabetical characters will be
		 	incremented or decremented.  This is useful for a list with a
		 	letter index a), b), etc.		*octal-nrformats*
		 octal	If included, numbers that start with a zero will be considered
		 	to be octal.  Example: Using CTRL-A on "007" results in "010".
		 hex	If included, numbers starting with "0x" or "0X" will be
		 	considered to be hexadecimal.  Example: Using CTRL-X on
		 	"0x100" results in "0x0ff".
		 bin	If included, numbers starting with "0b" or "0B" will be
		 	considered to be binary.  Example: Using CTRL-X on
		 	"0b1000" subtracts one, resulting in "0b0111".
		 unsigned    If included, numbers are recognized as unsigned. Thus a
		 	leading dash or negative sign won't be considered as part of
		 	the number.  Examples:
		 	    Using CTRL-X on "2020" in "9-2020" results in "9-2019"
		 	    (without "unsigned" it would become "9-2021").
		 	    Using CTRL-A on "2020" in "9-2020" results in "9-2021"
		 	    (without "unsigned" it would become "9-2019").
		 	    Using CTRL-X on "0" or CTRL-A on "18446744073709551615"
		 	    (2^64 - 1) has no effect, overflow is prevented.
		 blank	If included, treat numbers as signed or unsigned based on
		 	preceding whitespace.  If a number with a leading dash has its
		 	dash immediately preceded by a non-whitespace character (i.e.,
		 	not a tab or a " "), the negative sign won't be considered as
		 	part of the number.  For example:
		 	    Using CTRL-A on "14" in "Carbon-14" results in "Carbon-15"
		 	    (without "blank" it would become "Carbon-13").
		 	    Using CTRL-X on "8" in "Carbon -8" results in "Carbon -9"
		 	    (because -8 is preceded by whitespace.  If "unsigned" was
		 	    set, it would result in "Carbon -7").
		 	If this format is included, overflow is prevented as if
		 	"unsigned" were set.  If both this format and "unsigned" are
		 	included, "unsigned" will take precedence.
		
		 Numbers which simply begin with a digit in the range 1-9 are always
		 considered decimal.  This also happens for numbers that are not
		 recognized as octal or hex.

		 provided that the file being searched for has a relative path (not
		 starting with "/", "./" or "../").  The directories in the 'path'
		 option may be relative or absolute.
		 - Use commas to separate directory names:
		
		 ```vim
		 	set path=.,/usr/local/include,/usr/include
		 ```
		 - Spaces can also be used to separate directory names.  To have a
		   space in a directory name, precede it with an extra backslash, and
		   escape the space:
		
		 ```vim
		 	set path=.,/dir/with\\\ space
		 ```
		 - To include a comma in a directory name precede it with an extra
		   backslash:
		
		 ```vim
		 	set path=.,/dir/with\\,comma
		 ```
		 - To search relative to the directory of the current file, use:
		
		 ```vim
		 	set path=.
		 ```
		 - To search in the current directory use an empty string between two
		   commas:
		
		 ```vim
		 	set path=,,
		 ```
		 - A directory name may end in a ':' or '/'.
		 - Environment variables are expanded `:set_env`.
		 - When using `netrw` URLs can be used.  For example, adding
		   "https://www.vim.org" will make ":find index.html" work.
		 - Search upwards and downwards in a directory tree using "*", "**" and
		   ";".  See `file-searching` for info and syntax.
		 - Careful with '\' characters, type two to get one in the option:
		
		 ```vim
		 	set path=.,c:\\include
		 ```
		 Or just use '/' instead:
		
		 ```vim
		 	set path=.,c:/include
		 ```
		 Don't forget "." or files won't even be found in the same directory as
		 the file!
		 The maximum length is limited.  How much depends on the system, mostly
		 it is something like 256 or 1024 characters.
		 You can check if all the include files are found, using the value of
		 'path', see `:checkpath`.
		 The use of `:set+=` and `:set-=` is preferred when adding or removing

		 uses another default.  To remove the current directory use:
		
		 ```vim
		 	set path-=
		 ```
		 To add the current directory use:
		
		 ```vim
		 	set path+=
		 ```
		 To use an environment variable, you probably need to replace the
		 separator.  Here is an example to append $INCL, in which directory
		 names are separated with a semicolon:
		
		 ```vim
		 	let &path = &path .. "," .. substitute($INCL, ';', ',', 'g')

		 A comma-separated list of word list names.  When the 'spell' option is
		 on spellchecking will be done for these languages.  Example:
		
		 ```vim
		 	set spelllang=en_us,nl,medical
		 ```
		 This means US English, Dutch and medical words are recognized.  Words
		 that are not recognized will be highlighted.
		 The word list name must consist of alphanumeric characters, a dash or
		 an underscore.  It should not include a comma or dot.  Using a dash is
		 recommended to separate the two letter language name from a
		 specification.  Thus "en-rare" is used for rare English words.
		 A region name must come last and have the form "_xx", where "xx" is
		 the two-letter, lower case region name.  You can use more than one
		 region by listing them: "en_us,en_ca" supports both US and Canadian
		 English, but not words specific for Australia, New Zealand or Great
		 Britain. (Note: currently en_au and en_nz dictionaries are older than
		 en_ca, en_gb and en_us).
		 If the name "cjk" is included East Asian characters are excluded from
		 spell checking.  This is useful when editing text that also has Asian
		 words.
		 Note that the "medical" dictionary does not exist, it is just an
		 example of a longer name.
		 						*E757*
		 As a special case the name of a .spl file can be given as-is.  The
		 first "_xx" in the name is removed and used as the region name
		 (_xx is an underscore, two letters and followed by a non-letter).
		 This is mainly for testing purposes.  You must make sure the correct
		 encoding is used, Vim doesn't check it.
		 How the related spell files are found is explained here: `spell-load`.
		
		 If the `spellfile.vim` plugin is active and you use a language name
		 for which Vim cannot find the .spl file in 'runtimepath' the plugin
		 will ask you if you want to download the file.
		
		 After this option has been set successfully, Vim will source the files
		 "spell/LANG.vim" in 'runtimepath'.  "LANG" is the value of 'spelllang'
		 up to the first character that is not an ASCII letter or number and
		 not a dash.  Also see `set-spc-auto`.

		 Name of the word list file where words are added for the `zg` and `zw`

		 							*E765*
		 It may also be a comma-separated list of names.  A count before the
		 `zg` and `zw` commands can be used to access each.  This allows using
		 a personal word list file and a project word list file.
		 When a word is added while this option is empty Vim will set it for
		 you: Using the first directory in 'runtimepath' that is writable.  If
		 there is no "spell" directory yet it will be created.  For the file
		 name the first language name that appears in 'spelllang' is used,
		 ignoring the region.
		 The resulting ".spl" file will be used for spell checking, it does not
		 have to appear in 'spelllang'.
		 Normally one file is used for all regions, but you can add the region
		 name if you want to.  However, it will then only be used when
		 'spellfile' is set to it, for entries in 'spelllang' only files
		 without region name will be found.

		```lua

		```
		
		---
		
		 Number of spaces that a <Tab> in the file counts for.  Also see
		 the `:retab` command, and the 'softtabstop' option.
		
		 Note: Setting 'tabstop' to any other value than 8 can make your file
		 appear wrong in many places.
		 The value must be more than 0 and less than 10000.
		
		 There are five main ways to use tabs in Vim:
		 1. Always keep 'tabstop' at 8, set 'softtabstop' and 'shiftwidth' to 4
		    (or 3 or whatever you prefer) and use 'noexpandtab'.  Then Vim
		    will use a mix of tabs and spaces, but typing <Tab> and <BS> will
		    behave like a tab appears every 4 (or 3) characters.
		    This is the recommended way, the file will look the same with other
		    tools and when listing it in a terminal.
		 2. Set 'softtabstop' and 'shiftwidth' to whatever you prefer and use
		    'expandtab'.  This way you will always insert spaces.  The
		    formatting will never be messed up when 'tabstop' is changed (leave
		    it at 8 just in case).  The file will be a bit larger.
		    You do need to check if no Tabs exist in the file.  You can get rid
		    of them by first setting 'expandtab' and using `%retab!`, making
		    sure the value of 'tabstop' is set correctly.
		 3. Set 'tabstop' and 'shiftwidth' to whatever you prefer and use
		    'expandtab'.  This way you will always insert spaces.  The
		    formatting will never be messed up when 'tabstop' is changed.
		    You do need to check if no Tabs exist in the file, just like in the
		    item just above.
		 4. Set 'tabstop' and 'shiftwidth' to whatever you prefer and use a
		    `modeline` to set these values when editing the file again.  Only
		    works when using Vim to edit the file, other tools assume a tabstop
		    is worth 8 spaces.
		 5. Always set 'tabstop' and 'shiftwidth' to the same value, and
		    'noexpandtab'.  This should then work (for initial indents only)
		    for any tabstop setting that people use.  It might be nice to have
		    tabs after the first non-blank inserted as spaces if you do this
		    though.  Otherwise aligned comments will be wrong when 'tabstop' is
		    changed.

		 For more information about this feature see `undo-persistence`.

		 Maximum number of changes that can be undone.  Since undo information
		 is kept in memory, higher numbers will cause more memory to be used.
		 Nevertheless, a single change can already use a large amount of memory.
		 Set to 0 for Vi compatibility: One level of undo and "u" undoes
		 itself:
		
		 ```vim
		 	set ul=0
		 ```
		 But you can also get Vi compatibility by including the 'u' flag in
		 'cpoptions', and still be able to use CTRL-R to repeat undo.
		 Also see `undo-two-ways`.
		 Set to -1 for no undo at all.  You might want to do this only for the
		 current buffer:
		
		 ```vim
		 	setlocal ul=-1
		 ```
		 This helps when you run out of memory for a single change.
		
		 The local value is set to -123456 when the global value is to be used.
