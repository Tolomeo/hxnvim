	---
	
	A code action represents a change that can be performed in code, e.g. to fix a problem or
	to refactor code.
	
	A CodeAction must set either `edit` and/or a `command`. If both are supplied, the `edit` is applied first, then the `command` is executed.

		Marks that the code action cannot currently be applied.
		
		Clients should follow the following guidelines regarding disabled code actions:
		
		  - Disabled code actions are not shown in automatic [lightbulbs](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/editingevolved#_code-action)
		    code action menus.
		
		  - Disabled actions are shown as faded out in the code action menu when the user requests a more specific type
		    of code action, such as refactorings.
		
		  - If the user has a [keybinding](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/refactoring#_keybindings-for-code-actions)
		    that auto applies a code action and only disabled code actions are returned, the client should show the user an
		    error message with `reason` in the editor.

	/**
		```lua
		(field) lsp.CodeAction.edit: (lsp.WorkspaceEdit)?
		```
		
		---
		
		A workspace edit represents changes to many resources managed in the workspace. The edit
		should either provide `changes` or `documentChanges`. If documentChanges are present
		they are preferred over `changes` if the client can handle versioned document edits.
		
		Since version 3.13.0 a workspace edit can contain resource operations as well. If resource
		operations are present clients need to execute the operations in the order in which they
		are provided. So a workspace edit for example can consist of the following two changes:
		(1) a create file a.txt and (2) a text document edit which insert text into file a.txt.
		
		An invalid sequence (e.g. (1) delete file a.txt and (2) insert text into file a.txt) will
		cause failure of the operation. How the client recovers from the failure is described by
		the client capability: `workspace.workspaceEdit.failureHandling`

		by keybindings.
		
		A quick fix should be marked preferred if it properly addresses the underlying error.
		A refactoring should be marked preferred if it is the most reasonable choice of actions to take.
