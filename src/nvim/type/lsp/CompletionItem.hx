		---
		
		A `MarkupContent` literal represents a string value which content is interpreted base on its
		kind flag. Currently the protocol supports `plaintext` and `markdown` as markup kinds.
		
		If the kind is `markdown` then the value can contain fenced code blocks like in GitHub issues.
		See https://help.github.com/articles/creating-and-highlighting-code-blocks/#syntax-highlighting
		
		Here is an example how such a string can be constructed using JavaScript / TypeScript:
		```ts
		let markdown: MarkdownContent = {
		 kind: MarkupKind.Markdown,
		 value: [
		   '# Header',
		   'Some text',
		   '```typescript',
		   'someCode();',
		   '```'
		 ].join('\n')
		};
		```
		
		*Please Note* that clients might sanitize the return markdown. A client could decide to
		remove HTML from the markdown to avoid script execution.

		is used.
		
		The `insertText` is subject to interpretation by the client side.
		Some tools might not take the string literally. For example
		VS Code when code complete is requested in this example
		`con<cursor position>` and a completion item with an `insertText` of
		`console` is provided it will only insert `sole`. Therefore it is
		recommended to use `textEdit` instead since it avoids additional client
		side interpretation.

		property.

		replace edit must be a [single line] and they must contain the position
		at which completion has been requested.

		must be a prefix of the edit's replace range, that means it must be
		contained and starting at the same position.
