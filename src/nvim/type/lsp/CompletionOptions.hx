		Most tools trigger completion request automatically without explicitly requesting
		it using a keyboard shortcut (e.g. Ctrl+Space). Typically they do so when the user
		starts to type an identifier. For example if the user types `c` in a JavaScript file
		code complete will automatically pop up present `console` besides others as a
		completion item. Characters that make up identifiers don't need to be listed here.
		
		If code complete should automatically be trigger on characters not being valid inside
		an identifier (for example `.` in JavaScript) list them in `triggerCharacters`.
