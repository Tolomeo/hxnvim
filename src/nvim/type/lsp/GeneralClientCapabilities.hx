		The position encodings supported by the client. Client and server
		have to agree on the same position encoding to ensure that offsets
		(e.g. character position in a line) are interpreted the same on both
		sides.
		
		To keep the protocol backwards compatible the following applies: if
		the value 'utf-16' is missing from the array of position encodings
		servers can assume that the client supports UTF-16. UTF-16 is
		therefore a mandatory encoding.
		
		If omitted it defaults to ['utf-16'].
		
		Implementation considerations: since the conversion from one encoding
		into another requires the content of the file / line the conversion
		is best done where the file is read which is usually on the server
		side.
