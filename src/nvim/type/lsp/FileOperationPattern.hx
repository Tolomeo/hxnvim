		The glob pattern to match. Glob patterns can have the following syntax:
		- `*` to match one or more characters in a path segment
		- `?` to match on one character in a path segment
		- `**` to match any number of path segments, including none
		- `{}` to group sub patterns into an OR expression. (e.g. `**\/*.{ts,js}` matches all TypeScript and JavaScript files)
		- `[]` to declare a range of characters to match in a path segment (e.g., `example.[0-9]` to match on `example.0`, `example.1`, …)
		- `[!...]` to negate a range of characters to match in a path segment (e.g., `example.[!0-9]` to match on `example.a`, `example.b`, but not `example.0`)
