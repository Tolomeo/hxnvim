		The editor will use this location for the hover and for code navigation

		location itself), it shows the hover that shows at the given location,
		and it shows a context menu with further code navigation commands.

		```lua
		(field) lsp.InlayHintLabelPart.tooltip: (string|lsp.MarkupContent)?
		```
		
		---
		
		A `MarkupContent` literal represents a string value which content is interpreted base on its
		kind flag. Currently the protocol supports `plaintext` and `markdown` as markup kinds.
		
		If the kind is `markdown` then the value can contain fenced code blocks like in GitHub issues.
		See https://help.github.com/articles/creating-and-highlighting-code-blocks/#syntax-highlighting
		
		Here is an example how such a string can be constructed using JavaScript / TypeScript:
		```ts
		let markdown: MarkdownContent = {
		 kind: MarkupKind.Markdown,
		 value: [
		   '# Header',
		   'Some text',
		   '```typescript',
		   'someCode();',
		   '```'
		 ].join('\n')
		};
		```
		
		*Please Note* that clients might sanitize the return markdown. A client could decide to
		remove HTML from the markdown to avoid script execution.

		The tooltip text when you hover over this label part. Depending on
		the client capability `inlayHint.resolveSupport` clients might resolve
		this property late using the resolve request.
