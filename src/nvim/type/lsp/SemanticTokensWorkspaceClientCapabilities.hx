		Whether the client implementation supports a refresh request sent from
		the server to the client.
		
		Note that this event is global and will force the client to refresh all
		semantic tokens currently shown. It should be used with absolute care
		and is useful for situation where a server for example detects a project
		wide change that requires such a calculation.
