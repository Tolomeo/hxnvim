		If a client supports `applyKind` it must support it for all fields
		that it supports that are listed in `CompletionList.applyKind`. This
		means when clients add support for new/future fields in completion
		items the MUST also support merge for them if those fields are
		defined in `CompletionList.applyKind`.
