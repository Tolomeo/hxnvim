		---
		
		A range in a text document expressed as (zero-based) start and end positions.
		
		If you want to specify a range that contains a line including the line ending
		character(s) then use an end position denoting the start of the next line.
		For example:
		```ts
		{
		    start: { line: 5, character: 23 }
		    end : { line 6, character : 0 }
		}
		```
		
		---
		
		
		The range of the text document to be manipulated. To insert
		text into a document create a range where start === end.
