		A `MarkupContent` literal represents a string value which content is interpreted base on its
		kind flag. Currently the protocol supports `plaintext` and `markdown` as markup kinds.
		
		If the kind is `markdown` then the value can contain fenced code blocks like in GitHub issues.
		See https://help.github.com/articles/creating-and-highlighting-code-blocks/#syntax-highlighting
		
		Here is an example how such a string can be constructed using JavaScript / TypeScript:
		```ts
		let markdown: MarkdownContent = {
		 kind: MarkupKind.Markdown,
		 value: [
		   '# Header',
		   'Some text',
		   '```typescript',
		   'someCode();',
		   '```'
		 ].join('\n')
		};
		```
		
		*Please Note* that clients might sanitize the return markdown. A client could decide to
		remove HTML from the markdown to avoid script execution.

		The hover's content

		MarkedString can be used to render human readable text. It is either a markdown string
		or a code-block that provides a language and a code snippet. The language identifier
		is semantically equal to the optional language identifier in fenced code blocks in GitHub
		issues. See https://help.github.com/articles/creating-and-highlighting-code-blocks/#syntax-highlighting
		
		The pair of a language and a value is an equivalent to markdown:
		```${language}
		${value}
		```
		
		Note that markdown strings will be sanitized - that means html will be escaped.

		```lua
		(field) lsp.Hover.range: (lsp.Range)?
		```
		
		---
		
		A range in a text document expressed as (zero-based) start and end positions.
		
		If you want to specify a range that contains a line including the line ending
		character(s) then use an end position denoting the start of the next line.
		For example:
		```ts
		{
		    start: { line: 5, character: 23 }
		    end : { line 6, character : 0 }
		}
		```
		
		---
		
		
		An optional range inside the text document that is used to
		visualize the hover, e.g. by changing the background color.
