/**
	```lua
	(class) lsp.MarkupContent
	```
	
	---
	
	A `MarkupContent` literal represents a string value which content is interpreted base on its
	kind flag. Currently the protocol supports `plaintext` and `markdown` as markup kinds.
	
	If the kind is `markdown` then the value can contain fenced code blocks like in GitHub issues.
	See https://help.github.com/articles/creating-and-highlighting-code-blocks/#syntax-highlighting
	
	Here is an example how such a string can be constructed using JavaScript / TypeScript:
	```ts
	let markdown: MarkdownContent = {
	 kind: MarkupKind.Markdown,
	 value: [
	   '# Header',
	   'Some text',
	   '```typescript',
	   'someCode();',
	   '```'
	 ].join('\n')
	};
	```
	
	*Please Note* that clients might sanitize the return markdown. A client could decide to
	remove HTML from the markdown to avoid script execution.
