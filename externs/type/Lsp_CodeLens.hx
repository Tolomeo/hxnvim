	---
	
	A code lens represents a {@link Command command} that should be shown along with
	source text, like the number of references, a way to run tests, etc.
	
	A code lens is _unresolved_ when no command is associated to it. For performance
	reasons the creation of a code lens and resolving should be done in two stages.

		A range in a text document expressed as (zero-based) start and end positions.
		
		If you want to specify a range that contains a line including the line ending
		character(s) then use an end position denoting the start of the next line.
		For example:
		```ts
		{
		    start: { line: 5, character: 23 }
		    end : { line 6, character : 0 }
		}
		```
		
		---
		
		
		The range in which this code lens is valid. Should only span a single line.
